As a first task, please complete the final project proposal assignment by July 9th.

Please post on your group discussion page:
1. Set up a public project GitHub repository and post the link
  a. https://github.com/Alec8888/DataScienceFinalProejct
2. Post the name of the leader of the group
3. Please conduct a first meeting and let me know of any non-responsive members.

The final project proposal should be 1-2 pages describing the following:
* problem statement: motivation and state-of-the-art methods (we encourage solving more up-to-date problems)
* dataset: size, attributes, characteristics (5V's of big data including volume, variety, and veracity)
* different tools and methods to be used (we encourage using methods taught as a basis and use advanced methods like an ensemble, parameter tuning, feature selection, etc. as a comparison)
* challenges and evaluation methods (we encourage conducting both runtime and accuracy evaluation of the system/methods)

From Proposal canvas page:
The project proposal (~2 pages) submission need to be in PDF describing the following:
1. Title of the project, student member names and IDs
2. Synopsis of the goal of the project and how it will apply data science to solve real-life problems, how it will leverage the techniques taught in class this semester
3. Details of the data set, problem statement, evaluation metric, baseline techniques to be used (preferably in recently literature to solve the same or similar problem), what kind of novelty/innovation/impact you would make.
